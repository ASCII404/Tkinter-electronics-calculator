# 💡 Python Tkinter Unit Calculator

This is a basic Python desktop app made with Tkinter that calculates common electrical units like **Ohms (Ω)**, **Power (W)**, **Voltage (V)**, and **Current (A)** using standard electrical formulas (e.g., Ohm’s Law).

> ⚠️ **Note:** The GUI is very basic and not designed for beauty. This was made purely to fulfill a project requirement — function over form.
